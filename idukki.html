      <p class="card-text text-center"><b>Idukki is a district created in 1972 in the state of Kerala. It is one of the most nature rich areas of Kerala and remains untouched by commercial tourism. The district is known for its dams and hydroelectric power plants over the numerous rivers that flow through the area and the rich forests that are home to indigenous flora and fauna. Unlike popular hill stations and tourist places of Kerala, Idukki is still relatively unknown to a lot of people, which is why it packed with many places to visit and experience.</b></p>
      <p class="card-text text-center"><b>The Idukki Arch dam is known as the first in Asia and the worldâ€™s second largest arch dam spreading over a height of 550ft. The dam was built over the Periyar River and between two mountains. The dam generates a lot of the electricity of the entire state. Tourists must visit this monumental dam that has gathered worldwide praise and applaud.</b></p>
